title: "Amounts"

<Info>
  Many functions in RugplaySDK accept an `amount` argument. Rather than always requiring a raw number, RugplaySDK supports **sentinel values** and the **`percent() helper`** to make expressing common amounts more convenient and readable.
</Info>

## Sentinel Values

Sentinel values are pre-defined constants that represent fixed percentages of a relevant balance. Depending on the function they are passed to, the percentage is applied against either your **cash balance** or your **held amount of a specific coin**.

| Sentinel                       | Aliases       | Percentage |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| `window.rugplaySDK.MAX`        | `PERCENT_100` | 100%       |
| `window.rugplaySDK.PERCENT_75` | —             | 75%        |
| `window.rugplaySDK.HALF`       | `PERCENT_50`  | 50%        |
| `window.rugplaySDK.PERCENT_25` | —             | 25%        |
| `window.rugplaySDK.NONE`       | `PERCENT_0`   | 0%         |

```javascript
// Sell everything you hold of a coin
await window.rugplaySDK.sellCoin("COIN_SYMBOL", window.rugplaySDK.MAX);

// Send half your cash balance to a user
await window.rugplaySDK.sendCash("USERNAME", window.rugplaySDK.HALF);

// Buy a coin using 75% of your cash balance
await window.rugplaySDK.buyCoin("COIN_SYMBOL", window.rugplaySDK.PERCENT_75);
```

<Warning>
  Passing `window.rugplaySDK.NONE` or `0` as the amount to any function will return `true` immediately without making a request, as there is nothing to do.
</Warning>

## The `percent()` Helper

For custom percentages not covered by the fixed sentinels, use the `percent()` helper:

```javascript
window.rugplaySDK.percent(value)
```

`value` must be a number between `0` and `100` inclusive. Passing a value outside this range will throw an error.

```javascript
// Buy a coin using 33% of your cash balance
await window.rugplaySDK.buyCoin("COIN_SYMBOL", window.rugplaySDK.percent(33));

// Sell 10% of your held amount of a coin
await window.rugplaySDK.sellCoin("COIN_SYMBOL", window.rugplaySDK.percent(10));

// Send 5% of your cash balance to a user
await window.rugplaySDK.sendCash("USERNAME", window.rugplaySDK.percent(5));
```

<Info>
  `percent()` returns a frozen object that the SDK recognises internally — it is not a raw number. You can store it in a variable and reuse it across multiple calls:

  ```javascript
  const tenth = window.rugplaySDK.percent(10);
  
  await window.rugplaySDK.buyCoin("COIN_A", tenth);
  await window.rugplaySDK.buyCoin("COIN_B", tenth);
  ```
</Info>

## Which Balance Does the Percentage Apply To?

Whether a percentage is applied against your cash balance or your coin holdings depends on the function:

| Function   | Percentage applies to    |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| `buyCoin`  | Cash balance             |
| `sellCoin` | Held amount of that coin |
| `sendCash` | Cash balance             |
| `sendCoin` | Held amount of that coin |
| `flipCoin` | Cash balance             |

## Raw Numbers

You can always pass a plain number instead of a sentinel or `percent()`. The value is used as-is with no percentage calculation:

```javascript
await window.rugplaySDK.buyCoin("COIN_SYMBOL", 500);
await window.rugplaySDK.sellCoin("COIN_SYMBOL", 1000000);
await window.rugplaySDK.sendCash("USERNAME", 250.50);
```
