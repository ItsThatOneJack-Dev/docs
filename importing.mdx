      <Accordion title="Userscript Managers">
        RugplaySDK can work as either a standalone userscript, providing utilities to other scripts, or as a dependency in another script, if you are developing a script, it is recommended you use RugplaySDK as a dependency, if you were directed here to install RugplaySDK, you are likely looking for the standalone version.

        <AccordionGroup>
          <Accordion title="Standalone">
            To use RugplaySDK as a standalone userscript, perform the following steps.

            <Steps>
              <Step title="Step 1">
                Visit [here](https://github.com/ItsThatOneJack-Dev/rugplaysdk/raw/refs/heads/main/RugplaySDK.user.js).
              </Step>
              <Step title="Step 2">
                Wait for your userscript manager to pop up.
              </Step>
              <Step title="Step 3">
                Click "Install" or "Update".
              </Step>
            </Steps>
          </Accordion>
          <Accordion title="As A Dependency">
            In your script's headers, add:

            ```javascript
            // @require https://github.com/ItsThatOneJack-Dev/rugplaysdk/raw/refs/heads/main/RugplaySDK.user.js
            ```

            Here's an example:

            ```javascript
            // ==UserScript==
            // @name         Rugplay Premium
            // @namespace    https://itoj.dev/
            // @version      1
            // @description  Take over the markets!
            // @author       ItsThatOneJack
            // @match        *://*.rugplay.com/*
            // @icon         https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?sz=64&domain=rugplay.com
            // @require      https://github.com/ItsThatOneJack-Dev/rugplaysdk/raw/refs/heads/main/RugplaySDK.user.js
            // ==/UserScript==
            ```
          </Accordion>
        </AccordionGroup>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Console">
        There are two main options here, you can copy and paste the file, but I recommend you run the following script in devtools console, it simply pulls the file from GitHub and runs it.

        ```javascript
        fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ItsThatOneJack-Dev/rugplaysdk/refs/heads/main/RugplaySDK.user.js").then(r => r.text()).then(code => eval(code));
        ```
