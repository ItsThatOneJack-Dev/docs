  <Accordion title="Buying a Coin">
    To buy a coin, use the following:

    ```javascript
    await window.rugplaySDK.buyCoin("COIN_SYMBOL", amount);
    ```

    The `amount` here is the amount of **cash** you want to spend, not the number of coins to receive.

    <Info>
      `buyCoin` supports sentinel values and `percent()` for the `amount` argument, which are calculated against your current cash balance:

      ```javascript
      await window.rugplaySDK.buyCoin("COIN_SYMBOL", window.rugplaySDK.HALF);
      await window.rugplaySDK.buyCoin("COIN_SYMBOL", window.rugplaySDK.percent(33));
      ```
    </Info>
    <Warning>
      Passing `window.rugplaySDK.NONE` or `0` as the amount will return `true` immediately without making a request, as there is nothing to do.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

    To sell a coin, use the following:

    ```javascript
    await window.rugplaySDK.sellCoin("COIN_SYMBOL", amount);

    <Info>
      `sellCoin` supports sentinel values and `percent()` for the `amount` argument, which are calculated against how much of that coin you currently hold:

      ```javascript
      await window.rugplaySDK.sellCoin("COIN_SYMBOL", window.rugplaySDK.MAX);
      await window.rugplaySDK.sellCoin("COIN_SYMBOL", window.rugplaySDK.percent(50));
      ```

    <Info>
      The side is always set to `heads` internally. Since the probability is identical either way, this has no effect on your odds.
