description: 'The introduction to this section of my documentation.'

I make a lot of projects, and not many of them ever reach completion, or are even published, I wrote an entire suite of command line tools specifically because I was bored one day. For this reason I have set up Mintlify on this domain so that I can hopefully publish more projects, as I can properly store their documentation, and link to it!

You will see more pages popping up here occasionally, as I get around to writing new entries!
